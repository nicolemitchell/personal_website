I am a master's student in computer science at Rice University, advised by Dr. Lydia Kavraki. My current research in chemoinformatics applies graph theory, network science and machine learning techniques to model drugs and predict their metabolism, which will help inform the safety and efficacy of medicines. I am broadly interested in developing methods of learning on structured data for biomedical applications. Given the senitive context of health, I am also passionate about ensuring these models have provable guarantees that support interpretability and fairness. I will be graduating with an MS in May 2020, and I am currently exploring opportunities for what to do next!
