 abstract = {Background: Docking large ligands, and especially peptides, to protein receptors is
still considered a challenge in computational structural biology. Besides the issue of
accurately scoring the binding modes of a protein-ligand complex produced by a molecular
docking tool, the conformational sampling of a large ligand is also often considered a
challenge because of its underlying combinatorial complexity. In this study, we evaluate the
impact of using parallelized and incremental paradigms on the accuracy and performance of
conformational sampling when docking large ligands. We use ﬁve datasets of protein-ligand
complexes involving ligands that could not be accurately docked by classical protein-ligand
docking tools in previous similar studies.

Results: Our computational evaluation shows that simply increasing the amount of
conformational sampling performed by a protein-ligand docking tool, such as Vina, by running
it for longer is rarely beneﬁcial. Instead, it is more eﬃcient and advantageous to run
several short instances of this docking tool in parallel and group their results together,
in a straightforward parallelized docking protocol. Even greater accuracy and eﬃciency are
achieved by our parallelized incremental meta-docking tool, DINC, showing the additional
beneﬁts of its incremental paradigm. Using DINC, we could accurately reproduce the vast
majority of the protein-ligand complexes we considered.

Conclusions: Our study suggests that, even when trying to dock large ligands to proteins,
the conformational sampling of the ligand should no longer be considered an issue, as simple
docking protocols using existing tools can solve it. Therefore, scoring should currently be
regarded as the biggest unmet challenge in molecular docking.
