  abstract = {Drug metabolism studies are a critical component of the drug design process.
              Metabolism of some drugs can lead to diminished therapeutic efficacy or even toxicity.
              The stability of a drug is expressed by the atoms, called Sites of Metabolism
              (SOMs), which undergo structural changes when that drug interacts with a metabolizing
              enzyme. Computationally predicting these metabolically labile atoms early
              on in the drug development process will enable pharmaceutical chemists to design
              molecules with favorable metabolic properties.

              A number of in silico methods have been developed for identifying SOMs, with a
              recent focus on machine learning due to its computational efficiency over structural
              modeling. Machine learning techniques classify atoms as SOMs based on feature
              vector representations. Existing approaches rely upon expert knowledge and often
              expensive experiments to engineer fixed atom descriptors with extensive sets of
              experimentally-derived attributes. However, models based upon learned instead of
              fixed representations have proven promising in other chemoinformatics tasks.

              Seeing molecules as attributed graphs, where atoms correspond to nodes and
              bonds correspond to edges, the SOM prediction problem can be formulated as a
              node classification task. We compare two methods of extracting node features from
              molecular graphs: a standard fingerprint generation strategy used by existing SOM
              prediction methods, which constructs task-agnostic node descriptors, and an unexplored
              approach based on a graph convolutional neural network, which learns taskspecific node
              encodings. Both methods take into account the node attributes and
              graph connectivity to generate descriptive atom representations. We experiment with
              parameters that can influence the performance of both feature extraction methods
              on a dataset commonly used in the literature for predicting SOMs.

              Despite the fact that the graph convolution approach requires more data and
              has more parameters to tune, we have achieved comparable performance between
              the two methods. Given enough data, we believe the graph convolution approach
              may reliably achieve improved performance over the fingerprint generation strategy.
              Our results indicate that the graph convolution approach can outperform the fixed
              fingerprint generation strategy when starting from molecular graphs that are not
              initialized with rich electro-chemical properties, demonstrating how learned
              representations could replace the need for expert-derived features for SOM prediction.
              Our results also illustrate the importance of tuning the feature extraction method to
              the metabolizing enzyme of interest.}
