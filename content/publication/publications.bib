  abstract = {Background: Docking large ligands, and especially peptides, to protein receptors is
      still considered a challenge in computational structural biology. Besides the issue of
      accurately scoring the binding modes of a protein-ligand complex produced by a molecular
      docking tool, the conformational sampling of a large ligand is also often considered a
      challenge because of its underlying combinatorial complexity. In this study, we evaluate the
      impact of using parallelized and incremental paradigms on the accuracy and performance of
      conformational sampling when docking large ligands. We use ﬁve datasets of protein-ligand
      complexes involving ligands that could not be accurately docked by classical protein-ligand
      docking tools in previous similar studies.
      
      Results: Our computational evaluation shows that simply increasing the amount of
      conformational sampling performed by a protein-ligand docking tool, such as Vina, by running
      it for longer is rarely beneﬁcial. Instead, it is more eﬃcient and advantageous to run
      several short instances of this docking tool in parallel and group their results together,
      in a straightforward parallelized docking protocol. Even greater accuracy and eﬃciency are
      achieved by our parallelized incremental meta-docking tool, DINC, showing the additional
      beneﬁts of its incremental paradigm. Using DINC, we could accurately reproduce the vast
      majority of the protein-ligand complexes we considered.
      
      Conclusions: Our study suggests that, even when trying to dock large ligands to proteins,
      the conformational sampling of the ligand should no longer be considered an issue, as simple
      docking protocols using existing tools can solve it. Therefore, scoring should currently be
      regarded as the biggest unmet challenge in molecular docking.
