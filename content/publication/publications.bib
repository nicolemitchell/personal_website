  abstract  = {A significant bottleneck in federated learning
              is the network communication cost of sending
              model updates from client devices to the central
              server. We propose a method to reduce this cost.
              Our method encodes quantized updates with an
              appropriate universal code, taking into account
              their empirical distribution. Because quantization
              introduces error, we select quantization levels by
              optimizing for the desired trade-off in average total
              bitrate and gradient distortion. We demonstrate
              empirically that in spite of the non-i.i.d. nature of
              federated learning, the rate–distortion frontier is
              consistent across datasets, optimizers, clients and
              training rounds, and within each setting, distortion
              reliably predicts model performance. This allows
              for a remarkably simple compression scheme that
              is near-optimal in many use cases, and outperforms TOP-K,
              DRIVE, 3LC and QSGD on the Stack Overflow next-word
              prediction benchmark.}

  abstract = {Drug metabolism studies are a critical component of the drug design process.
              Metabolism of some drugs can lead to diminished therapeutic efficacy or even toxicity.
              The stability of a drug is expressed by the atoms, called Sites of Metabolism
              (SOMs), which undergo structural changes when that drug interacts with a metabolizing
              enzyme. Computationally predicting these metabolically labile atoms early
              on in the drug development process will enable pharmaceutical chemists to design
              molecules with favorable metabolic properties.

              A number of in silico methods have been developed for identifying SOMs, with a
              recent focus on machine learning due to its computational efficiency over structural
              modeling. Machine learning techniques classify atoms as SOMs based on feature
              vector representations. Existing approaches rely upon expert knowledge and often
              expensive experiments to engineer fixed atom descriptors with extensive sets of
              experimentally-derived attributes. However, models based upon learned instead of
              fixed representations have proven promising in other chemoinformatics tasks.

              Seeing molecules as attributed graphs, where atoms correspond to nodes and
              bonds correspond to edges, the SOM prediction problem can be formulated as a
              node classification task. We compare two methods of extracting node features from
              molecular graphs: a standard fingerprint generation strategy used by existing SOM
              prediction methods, which constructs task-agnostic node descriptors, and an unexplored
              approach based on a graph convolutional neural network, which learns taskspecific node
              encodings. Both methods take into account the node attributes and
              graph connectivity to generate descriptive atom representations. We experiment with
              parameters that can influence the performance of both feature extraction methods
              on a dataset commonly used in the literature for predicting SOMs.

              Despite the fact that the graph convolution approach requires more data and
              has more parameters to tune, we have achieved comparable performance between
              the two methods. Given enough data, we believe the graph convolution approach
              may reliably achieve improved performance over the fingerprint generation strategy.
              Our results indicate that the graph convolution approach can outperform the fixed
              fingerprint generation strategy when starting from molecular graphs that are not
              initialized with rich electro-chemical properties, demonstrating how learned
              representations could replace the need for expert-derived features for SOM prediction.
              Our results also illustrate the importance of tuning the feature extraction method to
              the metabolizing enzyme of interest.}

  abstract = {Background: Docking large ligands, and especially peptides, to protein receptors is
      still considered a challenge in computational structural biology. Besides the issue of
      accurately scoring the binding modes of a protein-ligand complex produced by a molecular
      docking tool, the conformational sampling of a large ligand is also often considered a
      challenge because of its underlying combinatorial complexity. In this study, we evaluate the
      impact of using parallelized and incremental paradigms on the accuracy and performance of
      conformational sampling when docking large ligands. We use ﬁve datasets of protein-ligand
      complexes involving ligands that could not be accurately docked by classical protein-ligand
      docking tools in previous similar studies.
      
      Results: Our computational evaluation shows that simply increasing the amount of
      conformational sampling performed by a protein-ligand docking tool, such as Vina, by running
      it for longer is rarely beneﬁcial. Instead, it is more eﬃcient and advantageous to run
      several short instances of this docking tool in parallel and group their results together,
      in a straightforward parallelized docking protocol. Even greater accuracy and eﬃciency are
      achieved by our parallelized incremental meta-docking tool, DINC, showing the additional
      beneﬁts of its incremental paradigm. Using DINC, we could accurately reproduce the vast
      majority of the protein-ligand complexes we considered.
      
      Conclusions: Our study suggests that, even when trying to dock large ligands to proteins,
      the conformational sampling of the ligand should no longer be considered an issue, as simple
      docking protocols using existing tools can solve it. Therefore, scoring should currently be
      regarded as the biggest unmet challenge in molecular docking.
